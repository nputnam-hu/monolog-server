        "So, the purpose of this product is ultimately designed to be a brainstorming tool that helps out creatives. And kind of the initial scope is really focused on two workflows, one being the primary. So this primary workflow is around like generating drafts for would-be like blog writers or writers of longer form content. So the idea is that throughout the day, you can say different ideas and concepts and anything that comes to mind. Maybe even today, what we saw in Bloomberg about, you know, companies going public and the lack thereof of, sorry, the decline in public companies. And you could write an article about what that'll mean for retirement and politics within the United States over the next kind of 20 plus years. And throughout the day, you have little thoughts, maybe you read something or something like that. And then what this would do at the end of the day is ultimately like send you a draft based on everything you said. And then each day you feed into it, it can like update that, give you recommendations for additional reading and kind of go beyond. So right now the audience is really focused on writers who distribute long form content digitally. And this kind of second workflow I mentioned is for people focused on organization instead of tasks. It might be like, hey, you know, remember to follow up on some of the research by the managing director at Leroy Hippo about companies public or public company decline and the Stocks Act in 2002 and regulations impact. And then it'll kind of start your day with like, hey, here are a couple actions you want to follow up on and kind of create a to-do list and maybe action on them themselves once the AI gets good enough. So in terms of like the user experience, what the flow is like is you'll have a little hardware device. You'll then press and hold, you know, some button or some physical thing. And then you'll speak just like how I'm speaking now. And then when you're done with that idea, you'll just let go or, you know, kind of finish it. And then you'll do that multiple times throughout the day. So either you and I have a conversation, we just, you know, do something like, oh man, great point, man. And then you'll hop in and create a quick recording on that. And you know, you'll do exactly what I'm doing now. Then you'll create different recordings and then you go from there. So even the ideal scenario is, hey, I'm trying to write this product spec. You know, it's a lot of words right now. You know, I'm using my phone because I don't have the hardware device designed yet. But I pick up my phone, I basically have a conversation in the same way that I'm having one with you. I put in this stuff, make sure to track this and when I'm done, I stop record. And then I'll keep adding stuff throughout the day. So at the end of the day, it processes all of them and then generate something. And I think some of our design principles here is focused on building like high quality tools for craft. So in the same way that someone who loves coffee buys those really expensive espresso machines, like that's the kind of aesthetic we're trying to go for. And there are a couple of wireframes that my buddy Noah's working on a couple of mockups. But I think, you know, when you get down to what the functional requirements are, like there are a couple of specific features you want to start with. The first is, you know, in lieu of the hardware, what is the recording kind of start and stop experience. Then once that recording is done, you will need to will need to kind of process that. And once that's processed, we're going to need to kind of sorry, we need to transcribe that. And once it's transcribed, we'll then need to like do a kind of read of it and see what were the main takeaways? What are those takeaways mean? Do they look like previous takeaways? Do we need to suggest something like those takeaways? And were these commands or recommendations and then organize things semantically and topically. And then that's on the software side. And on the hardware side, really, what we need to do is we need to be able to capture voice, save voice. And then ultimately, when you dock or connect this thing to your desktop, we're focused on desktop for now, not mobile, um, we'll then need to like download and pull in the files like automatically from the device, ideally without like kind of hardware permissions and communication between the device. Exactly, exactly. That communication between device and laptop, you jack in, and then it automatically downloads runs that does the transcript, and then runs these kind of like pre processing routines that I'd mentioned, before it even begins to generate what are some of the summary that is in going to be that is going to be in draft form. In terms of the non function requirements, performance, yeah, we want it to be as fast as possible. Now we're going to use GPT for through API's to get it done. But we could even the new transcription tool I'm about to test this with uses local models that you could download for free. And that might be something that we do for privacy standpoint. But from a scalability standpoint, GPT lets us test as quickly as possible. But it's, you know, less secure than running something locally that does that processing. And I think so, I mentioned some of the how the software is supposed to behave. You know, at the high level, the software like takes in transcripts, and then ultimately pumps out like drafts, and like tasks, if you will. And I think, you know, Noah has way more on kind of the components, and the behavioral specifications as well. Then when we think about like talking to stakeholders, right now, we're trying to cultivate and build an alpha base. So anyone who's in creative stuff, so I got connected with Rondel and a couple other people. And you know, that'll be kind of figured out. Noah and I are still hashing out the engineering stuff. The test cases really just to the extent that you're writing something, you know, this should be able to help you get to it. Customer service right now is just you're just gonna have to text me or text Noah. Marketing right now is just word of mouth. our deployment plan, we want to be live by with an alpha at least by end of summer. And then hopefully maybe by end of year, we can at least like start selling and then sell at least one thing. Sales collateral since we're prominently marketing through Twitter, this kind of like high end niche stuff is going to be pretty light. We're thinking probably a couple blog posts, something that outlines the design process, and then kind of build from there. When it comes to change management, version control, I think we're going to set up the get and then we'll manage version control through that. Change requests, right now, we'll have to kind of triage user requests, we'll probably actually run that through GPT. And then that'll create our kind of product backlog. And then when we think about impact analysis, probably the biggest thing will be like number of like drafts generated, because then we know people are both recording and looking at like drafts kind of repeatedly. High fidelity prototype, that's what we're working on right now. And then we have a couple of competitors that we looked at.",
