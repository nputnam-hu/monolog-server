        "There's an opportunity emerging in private markets right now, that is creating a dislocation. And most simply, it's that the amount of capital raised does not correlate to the amount of investable opportunities that are coming through the pipeline. Said another way, for the low end of the market, both at the venture capital stage and at the middle market and lower middle market stage, more and more AUM is seeking to be deployed in companies and opportunities that can deliver the same return that LPs have expected historically. But because we're now in a new macro environment, we've just come off the last 10 plus years, the longest bull run in recorded history in the stock market, and with persistently low rates. Now that that's reversing and rates are a little bit higher for longer, and if you maintain the view that we have, which is that rates will stay elevated, particularly as the debt to GDP ratio in the United States becomes increasingly untenable. As a result, LPs and private allocators, given demographic demands, will need to seek returns that provide liquidity in competitive rates. Given that the risk-free rate itself is also now higher, there is now even more onus on alternative assets that deliver attractive returns on a risk-adjusted basis. In venture, this means that we're likely to see less funds that survive to raise another round, and we're also likely to see valuations of startups ultimately come down. And this is because the AUM raised and the return expectations are from the ZURP era, but the opportunity is from the new era. And where are the companies going to come from that fund this opportunity? A similar trend is happening in private equity, and in fact, across alternatives broadly, there are a couple of trends that make this space increasingly more competitive and more difficult to deliver the same returns. One, more and more people want to be alternative asset managers, whether it's BlackRock moving to alternative assets, whether it's every MBA student who ultimately wants to do a search fund or work in private equity, or whether it's existing private equity players like KKR trying to break into retail, have permanent capital solutions, and one day hit the holy grail of getting into 401ks. All of these efforts are just a consequence of the space getting more sophisticated. Within this more sophisticated space, though, there is not necessarily a commensurate pipeline of new companies that can deliver these returns being formed by people on the margin, or being able to be bought at attractive entry multiples. So in the private equity space, the only choice that people have is ultimately to be an asset gatherer like the large firms like Apollo, KKR, and Bain Capital, and when you have that much AUM, at a certain point, all nails, when you have that amount of AUM and that single hammer, everything starts to look like a nail. So we're starting to see increasing esoteric deals, we're starting to see buyouts of law firms, we're seeing buyouts of Paramount Studios, and there is a question to be asked about where will additional returns, juice, and leverage come from, but ultimately because of their large AUM, they're still going to be able to get financing at an attractive rate. Moving to the middle market, it's going to be much more competitive. Companies can either overpay as more firms bid for the same pool of attractive companies, you either will need to have proprietary deal flow, you'll either overpay versus your competitors, but if you overpay versus your competitors, where are you going to get, what is that going to do for your returns, ultimately? And now what we're seeing in that middle market space is people starting to add operating platforms. They'll hire an operating partner, or a couple operating associates, or have a portfolio operations team, and their hope is that they can go in, adjust some of the line items within the firm, and hopefully be able to deliver the same returns. Given that the return expectations are now higher, and financing is now more expensive, the main source of PE returns historically has been margin expansion facilitated by attractive financing. But now that financing is much more expensive, firms will have to stake commensurate amounts of equity, which ultimately decreases private equity shark ratio, but more importantly, decreases their expected return. So these operating partners better do something that's unique and differentiated because every other player is doing operations as well. That's now baked into the return profile assumptions. But these are investors, not operating platforms, so to the extent they'll be able to scale their operating expertise does not scale in the same way that you could apply financing, so that may be a persistent issue over time. And we expect, I think, margins from pure operating contributions to converge and ultimately fall flat, because they'll become commoditized. So then all that there's left to do is buy companies that are a little less mature than you would have historically. So firms need to go to companies that are earlier in their life cycle, have smaller EBITDAs, and pay on a multiples basis a bit lower than they would have historically for what is a company they're going to have to do more work for, and the nature of that work is increasingly becoming commoditized. I think that this is a very difficult proposition for private equity, and I think we're going to start to see at the lowest end of the market, the smallest private equity deals happen at smaller and smaller enterprise values. As value shifts to company sellers in the middle market, the only way for PE people to get the same return is to go buy something that's a little more nascent. And at the bottom end of the market, perhaps the most nascent firm one could buy is something that doesn't even have positive cash flow, or has not even generated positive EBITDA quite yet. This historically has been the space of venture and some growth equity, which I think turns to main thesis number two, which is that at the low end of the private equity market, we expect to see convergence with venture. So historically, there have been great companies that would have been on the venture track of funding, but venture expectations are even more aggressive than that of private equity, and as we've seen in growth equity, there's a lot of great businesses that ultimately don't deliver venture returns that VCs have to pull out of, because they're not going to make money for their fund. The fund math just doesn't work. But now we have these growth equity firms who've done investments in these types of businesses who now need to mark down their expectations of these firms, and LPs are asking for liquidity. I think we're going to expect to see a lot of activity in the secondaries market, where because growth equity investors will need to take liquidity in the form of pennies on the dollar, they are going to be willing to take cheaper prices for these firms just so they can get cash to LPs, and LPs may not be happy with that, but at least they'll have cash in the door to meet their funding obligations. And within the high net worth space, that may cost that growth fund a re-up round. So we expect to see contraction in terms of growth equity as well. Then in the venture space, similar dynamic. Lots of large funds, but that doesn't necessarily translate to the marginal formation of a venture backable company coming to market. So we started with asking, what's stopping the marginal firm being built? What's stopping a pool of great would-be founders from getting started? What is the new minimum that actually a new type of buyer is willing to buy with regards to a firm? Maybe the lowest end middle market or private equity player is interested in buying a company that has proven product market fit, has some good users, early contracts, etc., but is not a full-fledged business. And maybe this new class of private equity players who now recognize that operations are going to have to be a larger contributor to their ultimate returns, may be willing to buy something, grow a little bit more, and get returns that way. I think this market dislocation that from the top is being driven by the macro environment, and from the bottom is also being driven by there not being enough high-quality companies being started, is where we want to insert ourselves right in the middle. And I believe the opportunity for Substrate ultimately is to use some of the new tools that we're seeing within artificial intelligence to ultimately incubate high-quality businesses that we can grow to a point and sell to would-be investors into what I believe is a new emerging category within the micro private equity space. And how we're going to do this is in phases. Phase one is the consulting phase, and this is primarily focused on working with Harvard Business School to get research on what the universe of total enterprise private market deals that have been done under $10 million in the last 10 years. We're then going to systematically outreach to a lot of these small businesses and get a sense for what their problems are in their day-to-day workflows. So as we go in, we're going to shadow these people. We're going to see what work they do. And we are currently developing an AI platform that can rapidly iterate and spin out like SAS tools, software, dashboards, and information that allows owners to basically get a personalized turnkey solution to their problems and to their workflows so that we can replace them with AI. And the more of this share of small business work that we can replace with AI, we're going to find the common themes and common industries where the problems that are best suited to being solved with AI are abundant. Once we have an understanding of that, we move to phase two, which is the buyout phase. In this phase, we'll take all our learnings from the consulting phase where we know what the problems are, and we've built the tools to solve them in a general sense. We're then going to buy a firm in our optimal target market, one that we believe has long-term growth opportunity and one that fits and has the types of problems that we're now good at solving with these AI tools, and try to do it ourselves. So we will streamline operations, increase and boost productivity, and ultimately turn the company to being as AI native as we can. And then ultimately, critically in phase two, we're going to exit this to a buyer. And if a buyer is now willing to buy our new AI-tooled solution, we'll have a sense of the types of terms we can expect, the types of margins we're able to generate, and now begin to get closer to a playbook of end-to-end. What are the businesses that have the types of problems, and who are the ultimate buyers once we implement our solutions? Then we move to phase three, which is scale, scaling, scaling up. So in this phase, we're focused on buying a couple more businesses, doing more of this AI stuff, learning best practices, doing regular sales, and starting to build a common platform around this now differentiated expertise we've cultivated over this past period. And then our final phase, phase four, is incubation. So now that we know what types of problems are best suited to AI, the types of margins they can deliver, and ultimately who are the buyers for this new class of firms, we will go out and start those firms ourselves. So we're going to build high-quality AI-first teams, technology products and companies, with lean teams, and then grow them to the point where we're able to sell them to an increasingly large pool of buyers. And I think the substrate opportunity is, as we're building these products, we will become at the forefront of what AI can do for tools, and what it can do for business, and in terms of how it can define what is a new market segment that many have never seen before.",
